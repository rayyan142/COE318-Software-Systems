# COE318-Software-Systems
This repository contains lab assignments for COE318-Software Systems at Toronto Metropolitan University. The course focused on object-oriented programming in Java and the software development cycle.

Each lab covered core Java concepts such as:
- Class design, object interaction, and modular programming
- Arrays, loops, ArrayLists, and user I/O
- Exception handling and debugging
- Testing with JUnit and building small-scale applications

Tools & Concepts:
- Java (OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
- JUnit Testing
- NetBeans IDE
- Modular design, testing, and debugging

Structure of Repository:
- Lab1 (Resistor) – Compiling & running Java programs
- Lab2 (Complex Number) – Immutable objects, multiple classes
- Lab3 (Counter) – Object linking
- Lab4 (Bank Account) – Arrays, loops, ArrayLists
- Lab5 (Blackjack) – JUnit testing & debugging
- Lab6 (Circuit) – Final modular application using interfaces
