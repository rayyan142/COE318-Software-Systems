# COE318-Software-Systems
This repository contains lab assignments for COE318-Software Systems at Toronto Metropolitan University. The course focused on object-oriented programming in Java and the software development cycle.

Each lab covered core Java concepts such as:
- Class design, object interaction, and modular programming.
- Arrays, loops, ArrayLists, and user I/O..
- Exception handling and debugging.
- Testing with JUnit and building small-scale applications.

Tools & Concepts:
- Java (OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation).
- JUnit Testing.
- NetBeans IDE.
- Modular design, testing, and debugging.

Structure of Repository:
- Lab1 (Resistor) : Implemented a Java class modeling a resistor with object-oriented principles.
- Lab2 (Complex Number) : Built a class to represent and operate on complex numbers.
- Lab3 (Counter) : Designed a modular counter system using encapsulation and class interaction.
- Lab4 (Bank Account) : Simulated a basic banking system with inheritance and exception handling.
- Lab5 (Blackjack) : Created a simplified Blackjack game using arrays, logic, and JUnit testing.
- Lab6 (Circuit) : Designed and tested a basic digital logic circuit (e.g., gates, switches).
- Lab7 (Analog Circuit) : Built and analyzed an analog circuit using simulation or lab equipment.
